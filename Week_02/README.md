Week 2 - Generative AI Lab Work
Implemented and trained a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using the MNIST or Fashion-MNIST dataset.
Designed a Generator to create synthetic images from noise and a Discriminator to classify real and fake images.
Trained the GAN with configurable parameters and saved generated image samples at regular intervals.
Generated 100 final synthetic images after training and evaluated them using a pre-trained classifier.
Observed training performance through generator and discriminator loss values.
